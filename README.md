# Drug2Sate
Drug2State is a computational ensemble under development for drug target discovery and repurposing by integrating multi-omic data with embeddings from foundation models like BioBERT and ChemBERTa, leveraging a Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) for nuanced mechanistic clustering of drugs.
